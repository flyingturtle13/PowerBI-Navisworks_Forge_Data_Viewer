# Power BI Building Assets Dashboard - Navisworks + Forge Viewer Integration
This examples explores a BIM workflow that allows project stakeholders to easily access and visualize BIM data and produce custom metrics.  This workflow uses Power BI as the interface to integrate the Navisworks model and Autodesk Forge.  Using Power BI as the interface enables teams to leverage Power BI tools to enhance communication by developing custom visual metrics.  A custom Navisworks plug-in is used to export system model properties using the GUID as the primary key to connect to the model in Forge.

**Note:** 
  * This custom pbiviz builds on original code provided by xiaodongliang. Learn more about Powr BI Forge Viewer Report [here](https://github.com/xiaodongliang/forgeviewer_embed_in_powerbi_report.git).  
  * Power BI template also requires exported tables from Navisworks using the System Properties Exporter add-in.  Learn more about System Properties Exporter [here](https://github.com/flyingturtle13/Navis-SystemPropertyExporter.git).

* User Interface
  - User to input Discipline / Building System
  - User to select associated model (similar to what is seen in the Selection Tree)
  - User to select model hierarchy level to export (entire system, system parts, individual components)
  - User to select which Property Category to export parameters
  - Creates a viewable list of property categories per discipline to be exported
  - User has ability to save and load a list of discipline property categories to export to eliminate list creation every time export is needed
  - Exported parameters are stored in an Excel file that the user can choose save location
